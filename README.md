# Library Management System

A simple console-based Library Management System implemented in Java. This project demonstrates the use of the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture while performing basic CRUD operations to manage a collection of books.

## Features
- **Add a Book**: Input the book's title, author, and publication year.
- **View All Books**: Display a list of all stored books.
- **Remove a Book**: Remove a book from the library by title.
- **Find a Book**: Search for a book by its title.
- **Console-Based Interface**: User-friendly and straightforward.

## Architecture
This project is structured using the **MVC design pattern**:
- **Model**: Represents the book data (`Book` class).
- **Controller**: Manages the logic and operations on the data (`LibraryController` class).
- **View**: Handles user interaction through the console (`Main` class).
